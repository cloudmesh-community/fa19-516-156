Wind energy operates on the principle of using moving air (wind) to spin a properller, which is connected to a
rotor that turns the arm of a generator to produce electricity.

Google is one of the leading Data cloud provider in SAAS and also focusing to use renewable energy. As per article in Zdnet page <https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-1-6-million-solar-panels-will-power-these-new-data-centres/>
Google is buying the output of 1.6 million solar panels to power two new data center campuses in the Southeastern US -- one in Tennessee and another in northern Alabama.

Also the same Zdnet article explain in last paragraph how myc electrictiy consumption used across all of its operations
"Google's operations rely on vast amounts of electricity; in in 2015, it consumed 5.7 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity across all of its operations, about the same as San Francisco used in the same year. In 2017 the company purchased more than seven billion kilowatt-hours of electricity (roughly as much as is used yearly by the state of Rhode Island) from solar and wind farms that were built specifically for it."
